Getting Started with Konstant

Hey there! Ready to dive into the world of decompiling with Konstant? Awesome! Let’s get you set up and running in no time.

1. Setting Up Konstant

First things first, we need to make sure Konstant is ready to roll. Here’s how to do that:

1. Find the `setup.bat` File
   Head to the folder where you downloaded or extracted Konstant. Look for a file named `setup.bat`.

2. Run `setup.bat`
   - Just double-click that `setup.bat` file to kick things off.
   - This little script will check if Python and some important modules (like `PyQt5`, `requests`, and `webbrowser`) are installed on your computer. If anything’s missing, it’ll try to grab it for you automatically.
   - Keep an eye out for any prompts that pop up while it’s running. Just follow the instructions!

2. Launching Konstant

Once you’ve got the setup done, it’s time to use Konstant.

1. Locate the "run.bat" File:
   In the same folder, you’ll see another file called "run.bat". 

2. Run "run.bat"
   - Give that file a double-click as well, and voilà! The Konstant app will open up.
   - You should see a nice interface with an editor for pasting your bytecode and a few buttons to get started.

3. Decompiling Like a Pro

Now that you’re in the app, let’s get to the good stuff—decompiling scripts!

-- Input Your Bytecode
  Grab the bytecode you’ve got from your script (using a compatible executor) and paste it into the input textbox.

-- Hit the Decompile Button
  Once you’ve pasted your bytecode, just click the "Decompile" button. Sit back and watch the magic happen—the decompiled code will appear in the output textbox below!

-- Saving Your Work
  Want to keep that decompiled code? No problem! Just click the save button for the input or output, and choose where you want to save it on your computer.

--A Few Things to Keep in Mind

- Remember, Konstant can only decompile bytecode, not regular scripts. Make sure you’re working with LocalScripts or ModuleScripts.

- If you’re trying to decompile something from ServerScriptService or ServerStorage, it’s a no-go. Those scripts are off-limits!

- If you hit any bumps in the road or see errors, don’t sweat it! Check out your executor’s docs or do a quick online search for help.

--Wrap-Up

And that’s it! You’re all set to start using Konstant for your decompiling needs. It’s super user-friendly and helps you get your bytecode in order. Just remember, this isn’t an exploiting server, so make sure you’re handling your scripts responsibly!

Have fun decompiling, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask around!
